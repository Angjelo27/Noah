# Wiring guide

All references are to the Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit. Header pins are
counted from the printed "1" on the carrier board (odd/even rows). **Never
connect or disconnect anything with power applied.**

## 1. E-ink panel (Waveshare IT8951 HAT (B))

The HAT is *not* stacked on the 40-pin header — it is wired with individual
jumpers so the enclosure can position it freely. The HAT header follows the
Raspberry Pi layout, so pin numbers match on both ends.

| Signal | Jetson 40-pin | HAT pin | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5V | pin 2 (and 4) | 5V (2/4) | ⚠️ One jumper sags under load — see §4. |
| GND | pin 6 (add 9/14) | GND (6/9/14) | More grounds = better. |
| SCK | pin 23 (SPI1_SCK) | CLK | 4 MHz max on jumper wiring — 12 MHz corrupts commands. |
| MOSI | pin 19 (SPI1_MOSI) | DIN | |
| MISO | pin 21 (SPI1_MISO) | DOUT | |
| CS | pin 24 | CS | Driven as GPIO (gpiochip0 line 136), not hardware CS. |
| RST | pin 11 | RST | gpiochip0 line 112. |
| BUSY (HRDY) | pin 13 | BUSY | gpiochip0 line 122. |

Panel specifics baked into the driver ([`software/eink.py`](../software/eink.py)):
VCOM **−1.58 V** (read your own panel's sticker and change `VCOM_MV`!),
SPI 4 MHz, 4-bits-per-pixel transfers.

**Pinmux is mandatory.** JetPack boots these pads in the wrong function; the
included [`fix-gpio-pinmux.service`](../software/system/fix-gpio-pinmux.service)
writes the pad registers with `busybox devmem` at every boot (SPI1 pads to
SFIO, CS and RST to GPIO, LED pads). Without it the panel reads all zeros.
Do not rely on `jetson-io` overlays — on this system they silently fail to
apply at boot.

## 2. Power button

A momentary switch across the **PWR BTN ↔ GND pins of the 12-pin button
header (J14)**. Behavior is implemented in software (`noah_ui.py` watches the
key events; systemd-logind is told to ignore the key):

- Short press: silent suspend / wake (model stays warm, ~3 s to usable).
- Hold ≈ 3 s: draws a persistent "FIKUR · POWERED OFF" screen, then clean
  shutdown. The image stays on the e-ink while the device is off.
- Short press while off: powers back on.

## 3. LEDs

| LED | Jetson pin (BOARD) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Power | 31 | Series resistor ≈ 330 Ω to GND. |
| Signal ("thinking") | 7 | Blinks while an answer is being generated. |

Both shine through the printed `NOAH_LED_Lens.stl`.

## 4. Power — read this twice

- Supply: USB-C PD, **15 V profile** (65 W class). The Jetson barrel/USB-C
  input takes it directly.
- ⚠️ **The 20 V cable trap.** Some USB-C cable + supply combinations negotiate
  **20 V**, which is above the dev kit's rating. During development one cable
  was found doing exactly that. Before running from any battery or new
  supply: verify the negotiated voltage with a USB-C power meter or
  multimeter, and physically mark known-good cables. Never power NOAH from
  an unverified cable.
- ⚠️ **5 V panel feed.** The e-ink drive current over a single 5 V jumper
  causes voltage sag: full-screen deep refreshes abort, and at the worst
  point half-screen refreshes failed silently. The software works around it
  (half-screen deep refreshes only), but the real fix is copper: run 5 V
  from **both** pin 2 and pin 4 and grounds from pins 6 + 9 + 14 (parallel
  jumpers), or better, a soldered harness. After reinforcement, the software
  can be switched to single-pass full-screen refreshes.
